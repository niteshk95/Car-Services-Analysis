In this project, I implemented the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to create a unified master dataset for automotive sales analysis.

Extract & Transform: Retrieved raw data from multiple Excel files and cleaned/organized it during the transformation stage.

Load: Imported the processed data into a SQL database and created a consolidated master dataset by integrating information from multiple related tables.

Visualization in Power BI: Connected the SQL master dataset to Power BI for interactive reporting and insights.

Cards to display KPIs like Total Cars.

Bar Charts to compare Cars by Fuel Type and Year-wise Sales.

Pie/Donut Charts to show Model-wise distribution and Transmission type share in sales.

This process streamlined data integration, ensured accuracy in reporting, and delivered interactive dashboards for better decision-making.
